# Managing Handle Access

Welcome to the guide on managing handle access with Nox. This section will help
you get started with controlling access to encrypted data.

## Overview

Handles are the on-chain representation of encrypted data. Managing access to
handles is crucial for ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt and use
the data. With Nox, you can easily manage handle access through direct
interactions with the Nox protocol contract.

Addresses can have different roles written in the handle ACL contract, which
determine their permissions:

| role \ permissions | decrypt | use as input | add viewer | allow admin | make public |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| none               | ❌      | ❌           | ❌         | ❌          | ❌          |
| viewer             | ✅      | ❌           | ❌         | ❌          | ❌          |
| admin              | ✅      | ✅           | ✅         | ✅          | ✅          |
| transient          | ✅      | ✅           | ❌         | ❌          | ❌          |

::: info

Transient access expires automatically at the end of the transaction — no revoke
needed. See [Transient Access](/guides/manage-handle-access/transient-access).
