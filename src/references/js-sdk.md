# JS SDK

The Nox JavaScript SDK (`@iexec-nox/handle`) provides a simple and secure
interface for interacting with the Nox protocol from JavaScript/TypeScript
applications. It enables developers to encrypt data and decrypt handles without
dealing with the underlying cryptographic complexity.

## Key Features

- **Easy Integration**: Works with both Ethers.js and Viem
- **Account Abstraction**: Supports ERC-4337 Smart Accounts via Viem
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with type inference
- **Secure**: Handles encryption, decryption, and signature management
  automatically
- **Gasless Decryption**: Uses EIP-712 signatures for authentication without
  requiring gas

## Core Concepts

### Handles

A handle is a 32-byte identifier that references encrypted data stored
off-chain. Handles are deterministic and can be verified on-chain through
cryptographic proofs.

### Handle Proofs

When encrypting data, the Handle Gateway returns a `handleProof` - a signed
EIP-712 payload that proves the handle was created by a legitimate Handle
Gateway. This proof is used when verifying handles in smart contracts.

### Access Control

Handles are protected by Access Control Lists (ACLs) managed on-chain. Only
authorized addresses (admin or viewers) can decrypt handles.
